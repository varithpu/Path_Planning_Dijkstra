# ENPM661_Project2
ENPM661 Project2 on Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

Instructions
1. Make sure cv2 library in installed
2. Run Dijkstra-pathplanning-Varith-Punturaumporn.py
3. The program will display map with blue obstracles (before inflated) 
4. The program will ask for start and goal node
5. Input start and goal node in command line, seperate x and y values by space
6. If inputs are out of map or are inside obstacles, the program will ask for new nodes 
7. Once all inputs are correct, the obstacles will be inflated to provide clearance of 5mm, inflated obstacles are displayed in green
8. The searching begins, start and goal nodes are displayed in red, and visited nodes are displayed in white
9. If the goal is visited, the program will draw a optimal path from start to goal node and print "Success"
10. If path is not found, the program will print "Failure
